I used the following medium article to guide me through the process of checking the maximum return stability of a portfolio.

I used the following resource to help me with Part 7: Build Efficient Frontier Portfolios since this was not provided in the lecture material.

Additionally, I used Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, to clarify the topic of Frontier Portfolios in the following way: 

Prompt Used: "please explain what a frontier portfolio is and why to use one"

GenAI Response: "A frontier portfolio refers to a portfolio that lies on the efficient frontier ‚Äî a concept from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) developed by Harry Markowitz.
üìå What is the Efficient Frontier?
The efficient frontier is a curve that shows the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
Each point (portfolio) on this frontier is called a frontier portfolio.

‚öñÔ∏è Key Concepts:
Return: The expected return of the portfolio.
Risk: Typically measured by standard deviation of returns.
Efficient Portfolio: A portfolio is efficient if no other portfolio exists with:
Higher return for the same or lower risk, or Lower risk for the same or higher return.

üß† Why Use a Frontier Portfolio?
Frontier portfolios help investors choose a risk-return balance that matches their preferences.
A conservative investor might choose a portfolio on the lower-left (low risk, low return).
A risk-tolerant investor might choose a portfolio on the upper-right (high risk, high return)."



No further use of GenAI or additional resources outside the provided resources were used for this project.
